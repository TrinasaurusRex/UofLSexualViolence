                <p>Remember, sexual harassment, assault and abuse are, unfortunately, not uncommon and you are not alone. There are others who have suffered in a similar way. It is also important to remember that no one has the right to sexually assault, attack, harass or abuse another person.</p>
                <p>In Lethbridge, free and confidential services can be found at our <strong><a href='http://www.uoflsexualviolence.com/resources.php' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>local sexual assault centre.</a></strong></p>
                <p>If the sexual assault is recent and you would like to be treated for sexually transmitted infections or possible pregnancy. You can find a list of walk-in clinics <strong><a href='http://www.uleth.ca/hr/health-centre/content/city-clinics' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>here.</a></strong></p>
                <p><strong><a href='http://www.uoflsexualviolence.com/resources.php' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>Reporting to police </a></strong> is optional, and there is no time limit on reporting. If you do this, you don't have to press charges, but you may save someone else from being similarly attacked or abused if police know who your perpetrator was.</p>
                <p>After a sexual assault, you may feel shock, embarrassment, shame, guilt, disbelief, anger, anxiety or nothing at all. These are all normal reactions to a violent crime. Similarly, sometimes months or even years after an assault, survivors re-experience feelings they had immediately following the attack. This is why it's a good idea to see a <strong><a href='http://www.uoflsexualviolence.com/resources.php' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>trained professional</a></strong> if you feel it is right for you. </p>

                <p>Avoid asking 'why' questions because they may sound accusatory. Avoid blaming in any way.</p>
                <p>Give contact information for a local sexual assault centre. In Lethbridge, free and confidential services can be found <strong><a href='http://www.uoflsexualviolence.com/resources.php' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>here.</a></strong></p>
                <p>If the individual is over 18, reporting to police is optional, and there is no time limit on reporting. Respect their decision, whatever it may be.</p>
                <p>However, you have a legal obligation to report the sexual abuse of a child to the authorities. If you’re unsure about who to call, you can call your <strong><a href='www.uoflsexualviolence.com/resources.php' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>local sexual assault centre</a></strong> for referral information. <strong>DO NOT</strong> contact parents if their child discloses sexual abuse; you must always contact the authorities first.</p>
                <p>Take care of yourself as well. It‘s never easy to hear that someone you care about has been sexually assaulted. It can also be confusing if you know both people involved. Find someone to talk to about your feelings, such as an expert at a <strong><a href='www.uoflsexualviolence.com/resources.php' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>sexual assault centre.</a></strong></p>
