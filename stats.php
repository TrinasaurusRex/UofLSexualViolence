      <h1>Statistics</h1>
      <br>

      <p>UofLSexualViolence conducted a survey about sexual assault on campus via the Facebook page “U of L Confessions”. This survey collected information about the occurrence of sexual violences and whether or not they were reported.  The survey was removed from the page by admins after 12 hours due to complaints of it not being a survey issued by the University itself.
The original survey can be found <strong><a href='http://goo.gl/forms/ahBTg8MRUj' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>here.</a></strong></p>
<p>The results are as follows:</p>
<p>In just 12 hours, 24 people said they were sexually assaulted or almost sexually assaulted on the U of L campus.</p> 
<p>Most of these assaults occured in University dorm rooms or the campus bar “The Zoo”.</p>
<p>Of the 24 survivors, 5 said that they reported the sexual violence to campus authorities, contradicting the Security offices’ reports of only <strong>EVER</strong> having 3 sexual assaults on campus. <strong><a href='http://www.uleth.ca/security/content/statistics' target='_blank' color='#4b85a8'>2 in 2015 and 1 in 2013.</a></strong> </p>
<p><strong>This means that the University of Lethbridge has a serious issue with collecting accurate information and in doing so is under reporting its statistics to make it appear as if their campus is a safe place. They not only ignore the issue, but actively put more students at risk for these kind of crimes.</strong></p> 
<p>If a student was sexually assualted and called the police, that information could be potentially omitted from Security Services statistics. If a student was sexually assaulted and reported it to Counselling Services or the U of L Health Center that information as well doesn't get passed along to Security Services.</p>
<p><Strong> This means that the only way to ensure a sexual violence on campus is recorded is to report it directly to Security Services.</strong></p>
